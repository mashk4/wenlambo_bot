# wenlambo telegram bot
This bot sends a motivation phrase to keep you on the track. 
Just add it to you group and send /motivation to get a bit of motivation for the day.

## Setup (for macOS)
```
git clone git@github.com:mashk4/wenlambo_bot.git
cd wenlambo_bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

``
You can use /help, /motivation commands and also try to send a photo :)
``

Then just add @weenlambo_bot to your test chat in Telegram.

But if you want just to test, then create a test group, and only after that invite that bot. Don't add it white group creating stage.

If you need a motivational phrase just type /motivation
